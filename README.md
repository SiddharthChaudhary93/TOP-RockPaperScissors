# TOP-RockPaperScissors

created the index.html styles.css and the javascript.js files

adding the required functions necessary to execute the commands

made the playRound function and tested various inputs 
also used toLowerCase to make in input case insensitive


made some more edits to the base js playRound to make the output more suitable

finished the game function and the final tweeks to make the game display the results in the console

the logic works perfectly for:
* The base function to generate the tandom computer output
* THe playRound function to play a round between the comp and the user
* the game function to play a game of 5 rounds and then decide who won in the end


**things to implement later:**
* UI
* all the necessart html fields and buttons to actually play the game on a webpage
